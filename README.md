# Ary - Strength-Spotting AI Companion

Ary is a strength-and-growth AI companion designed to help people see and articulate their professional capabilities through natural conversation and structured reflection.

## Philosophy

Ary operates on core principles:
- **Non-evaluative**: No scoring, ranking, or judgment
- **Competence-focused**: Illuminates existing strengths, not gaps
- **User sovereignty**: Complete control over data and experience
- **Institutional trust**: Designed for safe deployment in universities and public agencies
- **Cognitive clarity**: Focus on reflection, not emotion or therapy
